## Python OOP Assignment
Q1. **What is the purpose of Python&#39;s OOP?**

Q2.**Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?**
--> it first looks in instance object then in classes then in superclasses.
Q3. **How do you distinguish between a class object and an instance object?**
--> class is a blueprint from which instance objects are created. Instance object is an instance of a class.
Q4. **What makes the first argument in a class’s method function special?**
-->first argument self is special because it has class's instance object as its first argument.
Q5. **What is the purpose of the __init__ method?**
--> __init__ method lets initialize object attributes of class.

Q6. **What is the process for creating a class instance?**
-->class instance can be created by calling class name with requirement arguments present in __int__ method.
Q7. **What is the process for creating a class?**
--> a class can be created by using class keyword.
Q8. **How would you define the superclasses of a class?**
-->superclass is a parent class from which subclasses/child classes inherit the features.
Q9. **What is the relationship between classes and modules?**
-->modules are files with .py extension which may contains variables, functions and even classes.
Q10. **How do you make instances and classes?**
--> we can make instances by calling class name with attributes present in __init__ method.
Q11. **Where and how should be class attributes created?**
-->class attributes creation can be done by simply assigning a value to a variable. class attributes should be created outside of __init__ method.
Q12. **Where and how are instance attributes created?**
-->instance attribute are created based on __init__ function and these should be created inside class name.
Q13. **What does the term &quot;self&quot; in a Python class mean?**
-->self refers to instance of class.
Q14. **How does a Python class handle operator overloading?**
-->it handles by providing extended fun
Q15. When do you consider allowing operator overloading of your classes?

Q16. What is the most popular form of operator overloading?

Q17. What are the two most important concepts to grasp in order to comprehend Python OOP code?

Q18. Describe three applications for exception processing.

Q19. What happens if you don&#39;t do something extra to treat an exception?

Q20. What are your options for recovering from an exception in your script?

Q21. Describe two methods for triggering exceptions in your script.

Q22. Identify two methods for specifying actions to be executed at termination time, regardless of
whether or not an exception exists.

Q23. What is the purpose of the try statement?

Q24. What are the two most popular try statement variations?

Q25. What is the purpose of the raise statement?

Q26. What does the assert statement do, and what other statement is it like?

Q27. What is the purpose of the with/as argument, and what other statement is it like?

Q28. What are *args, **kwargs?

Q29. How can I pass optional or keyword parameters from one function to another?

Q30. What are Lambda Functions?

Q31. Explain Inheritance in Python with an example?

Q32. Suppose class C inherits from classes A and B as class C(A,B).Classes A and B both have their own versions of method func(). If we call func() from an object of class C, which version gets invoked?

Q33. Which methods/functions do we use to determine the type of instance and inheritance?

Q34.Explain the use of the 'nonlocal' keyword in Python.

Q35. What is the global keyword?
